## Data Analysis 4: Average Lead Time and Manufacturing Costs

We analyzed the average manufacturing lead time and costs associated with each product type. The analysis highlights that skincare and cosmetics have shorter manufacturing lead times compared to haircare. However, skincare products face delivery delays despite efficient production. Cosmetics, despite having the lowest manufacturing costs, contribute the least to the company’s revenue, suggesting potential areas for improvement in marketing or distribution.

## Data Analysis 6: Revenue by Shipping Carrier

We examined revenue contributions from different shipping carriers.

### Visualization:

*Carrier B emerges as the most frequently used carrier, contributing the highest revenue among the three carriers employed by the company.*

---

## Data Analysis 7: Shipping Costs by Carrier

We analyzed the shipping costs for each carrier.

### Visualization:

*The analysis shows that while the average shipping costs for all carriers are nearly identical, Carrier B incurs the highest total costs. This is likely due to its frequent usage as the primary shipping option.*

---

## Data Analysis 8: SKU Performance Analysis

### Visualization 1:
![Revenue by SKU](https://github.com/ManuKashyap01/Supply_chain_analysis/blob/main/revenue_generated_sku.png)

*The analysis reveals high volatility in revenue performance across SKUs, ranging from 1k to 10k. While some SKUs consistently achieve high revenue, many fluctuate, and some perform poorly, indicating opportunities for portfolio optimization.*

### Visualization 2:
![Revenue and Stock Levels](https://github.com/ManuKashyap01/Supply_chain_analysis/blob/main/revenue_stock_level_sku.png)

*Further analysis shows mismatches between stock levels and revenue, with some periods of overstocking not yielding proportional revenue increases. Stockouts during high-revenue periods highlight lost sales opportunities.*

### Visualization 3:
![Order Quantities and Stock Levels](https://github.com/ManuKashyap01/Supply_chain_analysis/blob/main/order_stock_level_sku.png)

*Order quantities also frequently mismatch with stock levels, resulting in inefficiencies such as overstocking during low-order periods and stockouts during high-demand periods.*

---

## Data Analysis 9: Defect Rates by Product Type

We analyzed defect rates across product types.

### Visualization:
![Defect Rates by Product Type](https://github.com/ManuKashyap01/Supply_chain_analysis/blob/main/defect_rates_product_type.png)

*Haircare products show the highest defect rates compared to skincare and cosmetics, indicating a need for stricter quality control measures.*

---

## Data Analysis 10: Defect Rates by Transportation Mode

We analyzed defect rates across different transportation modes.

### Visualization:
![Defect Rates by Transportation Mode](https://github.com/ManuKashyap01/Supply_chain_analysis/blob/main/defect_rate_transport_mode.png)

*The analysis reveals that road transport contributes the most to defect rates, while air transport maintains the lowest defect rates, suggesting it is the most reliable mode of transportation.*

## Conclusion

The supply chain analysis highlights that skincare products are the primary revenue drivers, contributing 45% of total sales. However, inefficiencies in inventory management, such as stockouts and overstocking, need to be addressed to optimize operations. Carrier B generates the most revenue but incurs higher shipping costs, and road transport shows the highest defect rates, requiring improvements in quality control. Female customers significantly contribute to skincare and cosmetics sales, while haircare appeals to a broader demographic. By addressing these gaps in operations, the company can enhance profitability and customer satisfaction. Addressing these inefficiencies can streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
